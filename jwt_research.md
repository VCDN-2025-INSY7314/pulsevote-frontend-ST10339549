# JWT Research (Pulsevote)

**Short summary:**
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, signed token format used to transmit claims (like a user ID) between client and server. It’s popular for stateless authentication: the server signs a token at login, and the client includes it in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header on each request—no server-side session storage needed. JWTs are necessary when you want horizontally scalable APIs and microservices that can verify identity with only the signing secret/public key. A JWT has three parts (header, payload, signature); the signature prevents tampering, but only if you keep secrets safe, use strong algorithms (e.g., HS256/RS256), set short expiries, and validate properly. If an app skips SSL/TLS, tokens and passwords can be stolen via on-path attacks or injected scripts (mixed content), letting attackers impersonate users. Real incidents have stemmed from JWT misconfig (e.g., accepting alg: none, or confusing HS256/RS256 keys), which allowed forged tokens and unauthorized access; disciplined validation and transport over HTTPS prevent these classes of failures.
